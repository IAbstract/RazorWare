Responsibilities and Liabilities under Android SDK License:
4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will protect 
	the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or 
	other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information 
	will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and 
	protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by 
	users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, 
	your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the 
	limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
	
4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any 
	third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or 
	applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which 
	Google may suffer) by doing so.
	
5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer credentials 
	that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely 
	responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
	
8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall 
	retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for 
	which, the user has given you permission to do so.
